# Wi-Fi Masterkey Script

The Wi-Fi Masterkey script is designed to allow users to view the available Wi-Fi profiles on their system and retrieve the password for a specified profile. In version 2 of the script, users can also input a new password to effectively change their Wi-Fi password.

## Usage:

Run the script in a command prompt or batch file.
The script will display the available Wi-Fi profiles on the system.
Enter the name of the Wi-Fi profile for which you want to retrieve the password.
The script will then display the password for the specified Wi-Fi profile.


## Version 2 Changes: 
**In version 2, users can input a new password to effectively change their Wi-Fi password. This functionality enhances the scriptâ€™s utility by allowing users to update their Wi-Fi credentials directly through the batch script.**
